============

In this section, we explain how Ivy compares to many other very important and related pieces of work, which also address fragmentation but at other areas within the ML stack.

Firstly, we need to look at the overall ML stack, and understand how the high level frameworks relate to the low level components.

In order to conceptualize this rather complex hierarchy, we have broken the ML stack into 9 groups, which are: :ref:`RWorks API Standards`, :ref:`RWorks Wrapper Frameworks`, :ref:`RWorks Frameworks`, :ref:`RWorks Graph Tracers`, :ref:`RWorks Exchange Formats`, :ref:`RWorks Compiler Infrastructure`, :ref:`RWorks Multi-Vendor Compiler Frameworks`, :ref:`RWorks Vendor-Specific APIs` and :ref:`RWorks Vendor-Specific Compilers`, going from high level to low level respectively.

   :width: 100%

Each of these groups within the ML stack has it's own sub-section, linked below, within which we discuss various related projects which operate at that particular level within the stack.

We then compare Ivy to some other ML-unifying companies which are working on very important problems and are helping to unify the lower levels of the ML stack.
We see these efforts as being very complimentary to Ivy's vision for high level unification.

Finally, we discuss how Ivy compares to each of these important works at all levels within the ML stack.
