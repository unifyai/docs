Ivy as a Framework
==================

On the :ref:`Building Blocks` page, we explored the role of the backend functional APIs, the Ivy functional API, the framework handler and the graph compiler.
These are parts are labelled as (a) in the image below.

On the :ref:`Ivy as a Transpiler` page, we explained the role of the backend-specific frontends in Ivy, and how these enable automatic code conversions between different ML frameworks.
This part is labelled as (b) in the image below.

So far, by considering parts (a) and (b), we have mainly treated Ivy as a fully functional framework with code conversion abilities.
Ivy builds on these primitives to create a fully-fledged ML framework with stateful classes, optimizers and convenience tools to get ML experiments running in very few lines of code.

Specifically, here we consider the :class:`ivy.Container` class, the :class:`ivy.Array` class and the stateful API.
These parts are labelled as (c) in the image below.

**Round Up**

Hopefully this has given you a good idea of how Ivy can be used as a fully-fledged ML framework.
