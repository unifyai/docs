title: 'Supported Endpoints'
---

Listing the supported models, providers and endpoints (model + provider pairs)
is very simple, and can be done either via [http requests](#http-requests) from any
programming language, or our own [Unify Python package](#unify-python-package)

## HTTP Requests

You can find a list of all models, all providers and all endpoints
(model + provider pairs) using the following commands:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/models' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/providers' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/endpoints' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

You can also pass models and providers as arguments to the above functions, to limit the
returned list, like so:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/models?provider=openai' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/providers?model=llama-3-8b-chat' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/endpoints?provider=openai' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/endpoints?model=llama-3-8b-chat' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

That's it, you can now easily list the models, provider and endpoints that are available
for querying (explained in the
[next section](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries)).

## Unify Python Package

The same functions can be called directly from the Python client, as follows:

```python
import unify

# return all
unify.utils.list_models()
unify.utils.list_providers()
unify.utils.list_endpoints()

# filtered
unify.utils.list_models("openai")
unify.utils.list_providers("llama-3-8b-chat")
unify.utils.list_endpoints(provider="openai")
unify.utils.list_endpoints(model="llama-3-8b-chat")
```

That's it! In the next section we'll see how these endpoints can actually be queried ✨
