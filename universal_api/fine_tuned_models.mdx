title: 'Fine-Tuned Models'
---

Fine-tuned models can often outperform generic foundation models in specialized domains.
Thankfully, adding custom fine-tuned models to your universal API is very easy.

We don't yet support *triggering* fine-tuning jobs from our API,
but we do natively support fine-tuned models from all LLM providers,
via our [custom endpoint API](https://console.unify.ai/endpoints) interface.

## The General Process

The general process of enabling the use of fine-tuned models through our platform
is common across all the providers. It involves 3 steps:

### Create a Custom API Key

- Use the [interface](https://console.unify.ai/keys) or the
[python client](https://docs.unify.ai/python/utils/custom_api_keys/create_custom_api_key)
and create a custom API key.
- The `name` of the key should be the provider you would like to use, you can use `unify.utils.list_providers()`
to get the list of supported providers. In case you'd like to use an API key that isn't among the supported providers,
you can create an API key with any name you like and pass it accordingly while creating the custom endpoint.
- The `value` of the key should be the credentials that you would want to pass to the provider.

### Creating a Custom Endpoint

- Use the [interface](https://console.unify.ai/endpoints) or the
[python client](https://docs.unify.ai/api-reference/custom_endpoints/create_custom_endpoint)
and create a custom endpoint.
- The `name` of the endpoint is what you will make a call to the unify API with.
- The `url` of the endpoint can be left empty (i.e. `''`) if you're using a model with one of the existing providers,
you would need to pass the url for accessing the endpoint in case you're using a custom provider.
- The `key_name` would be the name of the custom API key you've created. For existing providers, the `key_name` should
just be the name of the provider, and for custom providers it should be whatever name you've set for the custom API key.
- The `model_name` would be the name of the endpoint as visible in the provider console. We've elaborated more on the
format of the model for some of the providers below, but it should essentially be the same name as what's used to query
through the provider API directly.

### Query the Custom Endpoint

- Once you've added the custom endpoint and API key as mentioned above, you can then use it to query it through the
[Unify API](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries).
- The format for querying the endpoint would be `<custom_endpoint_name>@custom_<provider>` for supported providers
and `<custom_endpoint_name>@<custom>` for custom providers.
- Making API calls using custom API keys doesn't affect your Unify credits as you will be charged through your own
provider-specific account.

## Example Providers

We have explained the usage of fine-tuned models for a few providers through our API. Fine-tuned models with other
providers can also be used in a similar way.

### OpenAI

- Here's OpenAI's [guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) for fine-tuning their models.
- The custom API key `value` would just be your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- After fine-tuning, you will see it with a name like `ft:<model>:<org>::<id>` which you would then need to add as
the `model_name` while creating the custom endpoint

### Mistral

- You can fine-tune Mistral AI models following [this](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/finetuning/) guide.
- The custom key `value` would be your `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
- The fine-tuned model would be named in a format similar to `ft:<model>:<id1>:<yyyymmdd>:<id2>` (you can copy it
from your console) which becomes the `model_name`.

### Vertex AI

- Vertex AI models can be fine-tuned referring
[this](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/tune-models) section of their docs.
- In case of the custom API key, you would need to pass in the `vertex_credentials` (the service account JSON content),
the `vertex_project` and the `vertex_location` as a JSON string to the `value`. For e.g. if you're using the python
client, you could do something like,
```
create_custom_api_key(
    "vertex-ai",
    json.dumps({
        "vertex_credentials": credentials,
        "vertex_project": project,
        "vertex_location": location,
    })
)
```
- Fine-tuned models with VertexAI need to be deployed as endpoints before they can be used, you should add the
numeric endpoint ID for the deployed endpoint as the `model_name`.

### Together AI

- Fine-tune your models referring [this](https://www.together.ai/blog/finetuning).
- The custom API key value would be your `TOGETHER_API_KEY`.
- After deploying the fine-tuned model, you can pass the `<user_email>/<model_name>-<dataset_name>-<id>` to the
`model_name` while creating the custom endpoint.

### Fireworks AI

- Here's the Fireworks AI [guide](https://docs.fireworks.ai/fine-tuning/fine-tuning-models) to fine-tune models.
- The custom API key value would be your `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`.
- First deploy the fine-tuned model, then pass in the `accounts/<user_id>/models/<model_id>` string copied
from your PEFT Addons as the `model_name`.
