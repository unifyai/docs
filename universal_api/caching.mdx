title: 'Caching'

Caching LLM responses can be useful for a variety of use cases. For example, if you're
creating a user-facing application, then it can help to speed up responses and save
money for common requests.

As another example, if you're building a complex multi-step LLM pipeline, caching makes
it much easier to debug, without needing to continually send the same queries to the
same LLMs over and over again, burning both time and money.

Caching is currently only supported via the Python client. Caching behind the API is not
yet supported. However, caching behind the API would be useful,
then feel free to [hop on a call](https://calendly.com/unify-chat/general)
or let us know in [discord](https://discord.com/invite/sXyFF8tDtm)!

Caching can be turned on in the client constructor, like so:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("gpt-4o@openai", cache=True)
client.generate("Hello.")  # queries LLM, saves query + response to .cache.json
client.generate("Hello.")  # does not query, loads from .cache.json
```

It can also be configured on a prompt-by-prompt basis:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("gpt-4o@openai")
client.generate("Hello.")  # queries LLM, does not save
client.generate("Hello.", cache=True)  # queries LLM, saves query + response to .cache.json
client.generate("Hello.")  # queries LLM, does not save nor load cache
client.generate("Hello.", cache=True)  # does not query, loads from .cache.json
```

The examples above are very contrived, but with multi-step LLM applications this caching
can be very helpful when debugging:

```python
import unify
from docs import pdf_text
from prompts import parse_doc, split_into_sections, summarize_sections
client = unify.Unify("gpt-4o@openai", cache=True)
# works fine
parsed = client.generate(pdf_text, system_message=parse_doc)
# works fine
sections = client.generate(parsed, system_message=split_into_sections)
# debugging, trying different system messages each time
summaries = client.generate(sections, system_message=summarize_sections)
```

By default, the `.cache.json` file will be created in your current working directory.
The location can be configured by setting the environment variable `UNIFY_CACHE_DIR`.

Deleting the `.cache.json` file will of course delete the entire cache,
and queries will once again be made to the LLMs. You can also open up the `.cache.json`
file in any text editor, and modify the cache on a query-by-query basis if needed.

It's also worth noting that this cache implementation is very simple. For production
scale caching of thousands or millions of prompts, a more efficient caching mechanisms
would be needed. If you need more sophisticated caching for your application,
