There’s an ever expanding ocean of models and providers, with new LLMs coming out all the 
time 🌊
Each provider requires a unique API key, unique payment processing system, and unique 
format for querying the API.
When testing out different models and providers, it can quickly become very cumbersome to 
manage all of these nuances 🫠

Our Universal API provides:

- A single, common interface for all models and providers 🟢
- One account, with one balance and one API key 🔑
