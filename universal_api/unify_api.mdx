title: 'Universal API'
---

There’s an ever expanding ocean of models and providers, with new LLMs coming out all the 
time 🌊
Each provider requires a unique API key, unique payment processing system, and unique 
format for querying the API.
When testing out different models and providers, it can quickly become very cumbersome to 
manage all of these nuances 🫠

Our Universal API provides:

- A single, common interface for all models and providers 🟢
- One account, with one balance and one API key 🔑

To get your universal API key, simply [sign up](https://console.unify.ai)!

## Querying the API

You can interact with the API via:

- `HTTP Requests` from any programming language
- Our own `Unify Python Package`
- The `OpenAI Python Package`
- The `OpenAI NodeJS Package`

### HTTP Requests

Run the following command in a terminal (replacing :code:`$UNIFY_KEY` with your own).

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello."}]
    }'
```

The `model` field is used to specify both the model and the provider, in the format 
`model@provider`.

You can find a list of all models, all providers and all endpoints (model + provider pairs) 
using the following commands:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/models' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/providers' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/endpoints' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

You can also pass models and providers as arguments to the above functions, to limit the 
returned list, like so:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/models?provider=<some_provider>' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/providers?model=<some_model>' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.unify.ai/v0/endpoints?<model or provider>=<some_model or some_provider>' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

Requests can easily be made from any language, for example using Python:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer UNIFY_API_KEY",
}
payload = {
    "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@together-ai",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello."}]
}
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

The response from a request should look something like this:

```python
{
    "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@together-ai",
    "created": 1718888877,
    "id": "896bfc1ae84271aa-LHR",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "usage": {
        "completion_tokens": 25,
        "prompt_tokens": 13,
        "total_tokens": 38,
        "cost": 7.6e-06
    },
    "choices": [
        {
        "finish_reason": "stop",
        "index": 0,
        "message": {
            "content": "Hello! It's nice to meet you. Is there something I can help you with or would you like to chat?",
            "role": "assistant",
        },
        "seed": 11563975138181362140
        }
    ]
}
```

The output from the LLM is accessed via `choices[0].message.content`.
The :code:`usage` field contains the number of prompt/completion tokens, as well as 
the total cost of the request, in US$.
In the request you can specify other common parameters, like `temperature`, `stream` and
`max_tokens`.

You can specify all of the parameters that OpenAI supports, but they may not be compatible
with every model or provider.

### Unify Python Package

First, download our [Python package](https://github.com/unifyai/unify) with 
`pip install unifyai`. You can then quickly get started like so:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai", api_key="$UNIFY_KEY")
response = client.generate("hello world!")
```

If you save your API key to the environment variables `UNIFY_KEY`,
then you don't need to specify the `api_key` argument in the example above.

You can list the models, providers and endpoints using the functions 
`unify.utils.list_models()`, `unify.utils.list_providers()` and 
`unify.utils.list_endpoints()`

### OpenAI Python Package

The Unify API is designed to be compatible with the OpenAI standard, so if you 
have existing code that uses the OpenAI Python package, it's straightforward to try 
out our API.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.unify.ai/v0/",
    api_key="YOUR_UNIFY_KEY"
)

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3@fireworks-ai",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi."}],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")
```

Remember that the `model` field needs to contain a string of the form `model@provider`.

### OpenAI NodeJS Package

Likewise, if you have existing code that uses the OpenAI NodeJS package, it's again very 
straightforward to try out our API.

```javascript
const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseUrl: "https://api.unify.ai/v0/",
  apiKey: "YOUR_UNIFY_KEY"
});

const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3@fireworks-ai",
  messages: [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi."}],
  stream: true
});
```

Again, remember that the `model` field needs to contain a string of the form 
`model@provider`.

## Billing

You only have to manage the balance and billing details for your Unify account, 
and we handle the spending with each provider behind the scenes.

You can see your balance, top-up your balance, and set automatic refill on the 
[billing page](https://console.unify.ai/billing).

You can also get your current credit balance with a HTTP request:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/get_credits' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

which will return something like:

```json
{
    "id": "your_user_id",
    "credits": 232.32
}
```

This is also supported in our Python client:

```python
import unify
credits = unify.utils.get_credits()
```

## Advanced features

### Custom Endpoints

If you have a custom model which is deployed as an endpoint on (for example a fine-tuned
model with OpenAI or Together AI) you can 
[add your own custom endpoint](https://console.unify.ai/endpoints).

To create a custom endpoint, you need the Endpoint URL and the relevant API key. You can 
query a custom endpoint using the model string `<endpoint-name>@custom`

### LLM Fallbacks

Sometimes individual providers have outages, which can disrupt live workflows in production. 

To combat this, set a list of fallback models, so if one provider is down or fails for some 
reason, the request will go to the next model on the list, and so on, until either the 
request succeeds, or the end of the list is reached.

To specify the list of fallback models, use `->` between individual model tags, so the 
model string becomes `model_a@provider_a->model_b@provider_b`.

There is no limit on the number of models that can be specified. The `model` field in the 
response contains the model and provider that the request actually went to.
