When making queries via
[HTTP Requests](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#http-requests),
the [OpenAI Python Package](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#openai-python-package),
and the [OpenAI NodeJS Package](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#openai-nodejs-package),
then the full `ChatCompletion` is returned, as per the
[OpenAI Standard](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object).

Firstly, lets take a look at how we can *format* these returned `ChatCompletion`
instances more elegantly, so we can easily examine the contents.

## Formatting

As a recap, requests can be made directly to our
[REST API](https://docs.unify.ai/api-reference/llm_queries/chat_completions) as follows:
```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello."}]
    }'
```
The response is printed on a single line by default, which is not very human-readable:
```
{"model":"llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai","created":1726589635,"id":"21f88b05-5aea-4e9d-8179-8959ac1c7c03","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":26,"prompt_tokens":13,"total_tokens":39,"completion_tokens_details":null,"cost":7.8e-6},"choices":[{"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,"message":{"content":"Hello! It's nice to meet you. Is there something I can help you with, or would you like to chat?","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null,"function_call":null}}]}
```
The [jq package](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) can be used to render the returned
`ChatCompletion` **much** more elegantly in the terminal:
```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello."}]
    }' | jq .
```
```json
{
  "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai",
  "created": 1726589999,
  "id": "5dba39ee-7354-4f98-802d-8666b0668ba1",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "usage": {
    "completion_tokens": 25,
    "prompt_tokens": 13,
    "total_tokens": 38,
    "completion_tokens_details": null,
    "cost": 0.0000076
  },
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "content": "Hello! It's nice to meet you. Is there something I can help you with or would you like to chat?",
        "role": "assistant",
        "tool_calls": null,
        "function_call": null
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Again, as a recap, requests can also be made via the
[OpenAI Python Package](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) as follows:

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.unify.ai/v0/",
    api_key=os.environ["UNIFY_KEY"]
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-3.1-405b-chat@fireworks-ai",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi."}]
)
print(response)
```
As with the REST API request, the response is printed on a *single line* by default:
```python
ChatCompletion(id='d5f1c31d-f802-4c66-a0ea-74a7163bb680', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Hi! How are you today?', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1726590242, model='llama-3.1-405b-chat@fireworks-ai', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=8, prompt_tokens=13, total_tokens=21, completion_tokens_details=None, cost=6.3e-05))
```
The [rich package](https://rich.readthedocs.io/) can be used to print the chat
completion **much** more elegantly:
```python
from rich import print
print(response)
```
```
ChatCompletion(
    id='a1148d09-48d7-48ab-9001-740af89cc759',
    choices=[
        Choice(
            finish_reason='stop',
            index=0,
            logprobs=None,
            message=ChatCompletionMessage(
                content="Hi! How's it going? Is there something I can help you
with or would you like to chat?",
                refusal=None,
                role='assistant',
                function_call=None,
                tool_calls=None
            )
        )
    ],
    created=1726590370,
    model='llama-3.1-405b-chat@fireworks-ai',
    object='chat.completion',
    service_tier=None,
    system_fingerprint=None,
    usage=CompletionUsage(
        completion_tokens=23,
        prompt_tokens=13,
        total_tokens=36,
        completion_tokens_details=None,
        cost=0.000108
    )
)
```

Finally, again as a recap, queries to the
[OpenAI NodeJS Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai) can be made as follows:

```js
const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseUrl: "https://api.unify.ai/v0/",
  apiKey: "UNIFY_KEY"
});

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "llama-3.1-405b-chat@fireworks-ai",
  messages: [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi."}]
});
console.log(response);
```
As with the previous two examples, the response is printed on a single line by default:
```
```
The [X]() package can be used to print the `ChatCompletion` **much** more elegantly:
```js
```

## Unify Python Client

In order to make things more user friendly, by default the
[Unify Python Client](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#unify-python-package)
only returns the message content of the *first choice* among the returned `choices`.
In Python, this is indexed like so: `response.choices[0].message.content`


```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai")
response = client.generate("hello world!")
print(response)
```
```
Hello World! It's nice to meet you! Is there something I can help you with, or would you like to chat?
```

The *full* `ChatCompletion` can also easily be returned in the Python client, by setting
`return_full_completion=True`, either in the constructor
(making it a [Default Argument](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/arguments#default-arguments)),
or in the `generate` method, as below:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai", return_full_completion=True)
response = client.generate("hello world!")
print(response)
```
In this case, the `ChatCompletion` returned only *prints* the `choices` field when
being displayed in the terminal, and includes nested formatting by default,
*without requiring an external library*:
```
ChatCompletion(
    choices=[
        Choice(
            finish_reason='stop',
            index=0,
            logprobs=None,
            message=ChatCompletionMessage(
                content="Hello World! It's great to meet you! Is there something
I can help you with, or would you like to chat about something in particular?",
                refusal=None,
                role='assistant',
                function_call=None,
                tool_calls=None
            )
        )
    ]
)
```

The reason we omit all other fields when *visualizing* `ChatCompletion` instances is
because Unify as a platform is primarily built for *evaluations*.
From this perspective, the focus is on tracking the *input-output behaviour* of LLMs.
We already explained our definition of a prompt in the
[Prompts](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/prompts) section.
As a recap, our definition of a prompt is as follows:

> A prompt is a json object containing all arguments in the OpenAI chat
> completions request body which **impact the output**.

Similarly, when it comes to *evaluating* LLM responses, we're only concerned with the
aspects in the `ChatCompletion` returned which are are **impacted by the input**.
Looking through OpenAI's
[ChatCompletion description](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object),
we can see that the only field which is affected by the input is the `choices` field.

As such, everything else returned in the `ChatCompletion` instance is *irrelevant*
from the perspective of *evaluations*, which is why we omit it during *visualization*.
If desired, you can view the full `ChatCompletion` instance with all meta data
(in the same nested manner), like so:

```python
from rich import print
print(response.dict())
```
```
{
    'id': '983c861b-5e60-472a-b198-01b01d8533f9',
    'choices': [
        {
            'finish_reason': 'stop',
            'index': 0,
            'logprobs': None,
            'message': {
                'content': "Hello World! It's great to meet you! Is there
something I can help you with, or would you like to chat?",
                'refusal': None,
                'role': 'assistant',
                'function_call': None,
                'tool_calls': None
            }
        }
    ],
    'created': 1726602280,
    'model': 'llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai',
    'object': 'chat.completion',
    'service_tier': None,
    'system_fingerprint': None,
    'usage': {
        'completion_tokens': 27,
        'prompt_tokens': 13,
        'total_tokens': 40,
        'completion_tokens_details': None,
        'cost': 8e-06
    }
}
```

## Broader Usage

Aside from being the default response type from the
[chat/completions](https://docs.unify.ai/api-reference/llm_queries/chat_completions)
endpoint, `ChatCompletion` instances are also what are *logged* in the platform
(see [Logging](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/logging) section), cached
(see [Caching](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/caching) section),
and stored in datasets
(see [Datasets](https://docs.unify.ai/benchmarking/datasets) section).

This section is mainly to give a quick introduction to the `ChatCompletion` return type,
explain how to print this in a human-readable way when making queries via the various
options available, and explain some of the design decisions we've made for our own
[Python client](https://github.com/unifyai/unify).

To learn more about what each field represents, you should consult
[OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object).
