## 🔍 Ignoring Mark Types

Lookg a bit deeper,
it seems we're getting the *same failures* as we were before.
These errors seem quite persistent,
we might need to make more radical changes to try and address them.

Let's revisit each of these failures again,
and explore them in more detail,
to see how we can rectify them.

Given the consistent prevalence of these errors,
it's useful to consider these failing examples **across all experiments**,
and see the different kinds of rationale our agent is giving across each run.

Our evaluation runs serve both as tests for comparing parameter configurations
(when the agent output depend strongly on the changed parameters 🔀)
**and** they also perform a kind of sampling from the noise distribution for each test set example
(when the agent output depends less strongly on the changed parameters across each experiment 📊).

This is one benefit of the flexible spreadsheet design.
Experiments are not indivisible atomic groups,
they're simply labels,
and the raw evaluation data can be juggled in whatever way makes sense to you as the user.

Let's first recap the fixed question ❓,
student answer 📝,
markscheme ☑️, and correct marks ✅,
before unpacking the various agent justifications 🤖 across all experiments.

<Accordion title="🤖 Predicted Marks [x/5] Rationale (with added insights💡)">

<Accordion title="simple_agent [1/5] ✅">
The full solution should involve several steps:
- Determining that in a 10‐litre mix, Peter uses 4 litres of red (2/5 of 10) and 6 litres of white (3/5 of 10).
- Calculating the cost per litre for each colour:
 - Red: £80/10 = £8 per litre, so 4 litres costs 4 × £8 = £32.
 - White: £5/10 = £0.50 per litre, so 6 litres costs 6 × £0.50 = £3.
- Adding the costs gives a total cost of £32 + £3 = £35.
- Subtracting this from the selling price, the profit per tin is £60 − £35 = £25.

The student's answer only identifies the paint volumes (4 litres red and 6 litres white) without completing the cost and profit calculations. [**No reference to M1 💡**]

<Accordion title="add_markscheme [0/5] ❌">
The student's response only states that Peter needs 4 litres of red paint and 6 litres of white paint per 10-litre batch.

<Accordion title="add_marking_guidelines [1/5] ✅">
The student only shows that a 10‐litre tin requires 4 litres red paint and 6 litres white paint (i.e. the ratio part), but they do not continue to use these figures to work out the cost or the profit. This is an incomplete answer which does not answer the question. [**No reference to M1 💡**]
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="add_structured_output [0/5] ❌">
The student's work shows part of the method by correctly determining that a 10‐litre batch contains 4 litres of red paint and 6 litres of white paint. However, the answer does not extend to calculate the cost of the red and white paint, nor does it compute the final profit per tin by subtracting the total cost from the selling price. According to the mark scheme, a correct final answer of £25 with full working is needed for 5 marks. Since the student has given only part of the working (the mix ratio) and omitted the critical profit calculation, the answer deserves only credit for knowing the ratio. In such cases, with insufficient working, the mark scheme permits awarding SC2 (2 marks) for an answer that states the correct profit value by implication. As the final profit figure is missing, awarding 2 marks is appropriate. [**No reference to M1 💡**]

<Accordion title="align_context [0/5] ❌">
The answer only shows that Peter uses 4 litres of red paint and 6 litres of white paint in a 10‑litre batch. However, the question asks for the profit per tin, which requires further calculation including the cost of the paints and then subtracting from the selling price (£60). No profit calculation or final numerical answer for the profit is given. As a result, none of the required steps for computing profit were provided. Therefore, no marks can be awarded. [**No reference to M1 💡**]
</Accordion>
</Accordion>

Again,
regardless of our parameter variations,
it seems as though the agent is not correctly understanding the M1 mark in the markscheme,
which clearly states `M1 for 10 × (2/5) = 4 litres red or for 10 × (3/5) = 6 litres white`.
Even on the two occassions where it got things right,
it feels like a lucky guess,
as this was not justified via the markscheme's M1 mark.

Example 132 (c) is failing for a slighly different reason,
and so we'll consider this separately.

In general,
as we get deeper into the evaluation iterations,
it's often wise to consider multiple failure modes **at once**.
Larger evals can be expensive to run,
and you generally want to use **all** of the newly gained knowledge to try and improve your agent in the next evaluation run,
even if this means making several unrelated changes to address several unrelated failure modes.

## 🔍 Lenient Reasoning

Let's perform the same deepe analysis for Example 132 (c),
and see what's going wrong in this case.

### Example 132 (c)

<Accordion title="❓ Parsed Question [2 Marks]">
A newspaper headline reads: 'High temperatures make more people buy ice cream!' Does the graph above prove this claim? Give a reason for your decision.

The answer indicates that the graph alone does not fully prove the claim since other factors might be involved, which adequately meets the criteria for the mark scheme. [**Not true, the student doesn't mention "other factors might be involved" 💡**]
</Accordion>

</Accordion>

In this case,
it's not so much an error with understanding the mark types,
it's more of an issue with falsely hallucinating things the student said,
or perhaps being very liberal in the interpretation.

Perhaps the agent is confusing the markscheme with the student answer.
The student's answer "we cannot be certain this trend always holds true" is very different to "there may be other factors involved".

The former (incorrect) assumes the trend does exist,
but just might not continue,
while the (correct) latter is a point about correlation != causation,
indicating the apparent causation may not exist at all.

</div>

Firstly,
the recurring problem for **Example 207 and 261**  seems to be that the agent doesn't remember and/or understand the different types of marks (B1, SC1, M1 etc.).
Let's be more explicit,
and parse each sub-question markscheme for the different mark types,
and add the explanations directly as part of the sub-question specific markschemes,
and see if this improves performance.

Let's first create a dictionary with the mark type explanations,
written in a more direct manner to accompany the subquestion-specific markschemes and to make it easier to parse:

```python
mark_types = {
    "M": "M{num} ({num_marks}) should be awarded if a correct method is used, and should not be lost for purely numerical errors.",
    "A": "A{num} ({num_marks}) should be awarded for an accurate answer, and this depends on preceding M (method) marks. If preceding M (method marks are not awarded, then A{num} cannot be awarded).",
    "B": "B{num} ({num_marks}) should be awarded for the correct final answer, a partially correct answer, or a correct intermediate stage (depending on how this is expressed and explained below). B{num} is independent of M (method) marks.",
    "SC": "SC{num} ({num_marks}) should be awarded for the special cases explained below, which are worthy of some credit.",
}
```

Let's then write a simple function to update each sub-question specific markscheme,
prepending the markscheme with the relevant definitions from our `mark_types` dict,
so that the agent has all the relevant information close at hand:

```python
@unify.traced(name="update_markscheme{subquestion}")
def update_markscheme(subquestion: str, markscheme: str):
    m_marks = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r"M\d+", markscheme))))
    a_marks = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r"A\d+", markscheme))))
    b_marks = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r"B\d+", markscheme))))
    sc_marks = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r"SC\d+", markscheme))))
    if not any(m_marks + a_marks + b_marks + sc_marks):
        return markscheme
    markscheme = (
        "{mark_types}With this in mind, marks should be awarded as follows:\n"
        + markscheme
    )
    for marks in (m_marks, a_marks, b_marks, sc_marks):
        for mark in marks:
            key = "".join(c for c in mark if not c.isdigit())
            num_marks = int("".join(c for c in mark if c.isdigit()))
            explanation = mark_types[key]
            explanation = explanation.replace(
                "{num}",
                str(num_marks),
            ).replace(
                "{num_marks}",
                "1 mark" if num_marks == 1 else f"{num_marks} marks",
            )
            markscheme = markscheme.replace(
                "{mark_types}",
                explanation + "\n{mark_types}",
            )
    markscheme = markscheme.replace(
        "{mark_types}",
        "",
    )
    return markscheme
```

Let's now update our `call_agent` method such that the markscheme changes are dynamically applied before passing to the agent:

```python {24-27}
@unify.traced
def call_agent(
    system_msg,
    question,
    sub_questions,
    markscheme,
    answer,

    with_subqs = len(markscheme) > 1
    response_format = create_response_format(
        list(markscheme.keys()) if with_subqs else None,
    )
    local_agent.set_response_format(response_format)
    if with_subqs:
        output_response_exp = output_response_explanations["with_subqs"]
        output_response_exp = output_response_exp.replace(
            "{subquestions}",
            ", ".join(list(markscheme.keys())),
        )
    else:
        output_response_exp = output_response_explanations["without_subqs"]
    markscheme = {
        k: update_markscheme(f"_{k}" if k != "_" else "", v)
        for k, v in markscheme.items()
    }
    local_agent.set_system_message(
        system_msg.replace(
            "{question}",
            textwrap.indent(question, " " * 4),
        )
        .replace(
            "{markscheme}",
            pretty_print_dict(markscheme, indent=4),
        )
        .replace(
            "{answer}",
            pretty_print_dict(answer, indent=4),
        )
        .replace(
            "{available_marks_total}",
            str(available_marks_total),
        )
        .replace(
            "{questions_markscheme_and_answers}",
            pretty_print_dict(
                {
                    k: {
                        "sub-question": sub_questions[k],
                        "markscheme": markscheme[k],
                        "answer": answer[k],
                    }
                    for k in sub_questions.keys()
                },
                indent=4,
            ),
        )
        .replace(
            "{output_response_explanation}",
            output_response_exp,
        ),
    )
    ret = local_agent.generate()
    if "```" in ret:
        ret = ret.split("```")[-2].lstrip("json")
    ret = response_format.model_validate_json(ret).model_dump()
    if not with_subqs:
        return {"_": ret}
    return ret
```

## 🔀 Clarify Strict Reasoning

We've just addressed the recurring problem for **Example 207 and 261**,
but the failure for **Example 132 (c)** was quite different.

Let's add another instructions to our `general_guidelines` variable,
with an imaginary extra piece of guidance,
to try and avoid the leniency we've observed in the marking of **Example 132 (c)**.

```
general_guidelines = (
    general_guidelines.rstrip("-")
    + """15.
When students are explaining something in their answer, then their explanation must make *exactly* the same point(s) as are made in the markscheme. The wording can be slightly different, but the underlying observations/reasons must be *identical*, unless otherwise stated *explicitly* in the markscheme.

----
"""
)
```

## 🧪 Rerun Tests

Now we've made *both* of these changes,
let's re-run our evals to see if *either* of these changes were able to address the problems they're intended to resolve.

```python {2}
with unify.Experiment(
    "align_guidelines_and_clarify_reasoning",
    overwrite=True,
), unify.Params(
    system_message=system_message,
    dataset="TestSet10",
    source=unify.get_source(),
):
    unify.map(
        evaluate,
        [dict(**d.entries, _system_message=system_message) for d in test_set_10],
        name="Evals",
    )
```

Our failure mechanisms are **exactly the same** as before,
clearly the agent is still struggling to correctly reason about the different mark types.

Let's take a look at the traces,
to ensure that the system message template has been implemented correctly,
and each LLM call has the template variables in the system message populated correctly.

<div
  style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: '56.25%', // 16:9 ratio
    height: 0,
  }}
>
  <iframe
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
      border: 'none'
    }}

    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>

It seems as though everything was implemented correctly,
and the per-LLM system messages look good ✅

Again, let's explore what's going wrong in the next iteration 🔁
