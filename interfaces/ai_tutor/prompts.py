QUESTION_DETECTION = """
Your task is to detect the numeric question numbers [1, 2, 3 etc.], letter sub-questions 
[a, b, c etc.] *and* roman numeral sub-sub-questions [i, ii, iii] that are present in 
the following text.

When deciding whether the number refers to a question, look at the *subsequent text*.

Does it look like a question or a description of a problem for subsequent
questioning? If so, then it's likely a question.

The first question on the page can either be a number (new question) or a letter (continuation of question on the previous page).

Please respond in the exact order presented on the current page, starting either with a number or a letter, whichever appears on the page first.

If there are any numbered questions on the page, then the first of these numbers will be `{n0}`.
The presence of this specific number {n0} before any explanatory text or question means that this represents the question number, and should be included in your answer.

If the *first question identifier* on the page is a letter (not a number), then this 
*first* letter will be `{c0}`. This is because question {n-1} on the previous page {explanation}. 
However, if the first question identifier is {n0}, then the any letters immediately 
following this number (or immediately following any other question number),
will always be `a`, and this will then ascend alphabetically until the next 
question number. Likewise, roman-numeral sub-sub-questions will always come after a 
letter, and will also be strictly ascending starting from `i`.

A full image of the page has also been included, please look at this image to help 
understand the page *layout*, which might help you make sense of which numbers 
indicate pages vs questions.

Remember, sometimes questions are split across **multiple 
pages**, with only letters starting on the next page without showing the previous 
question number, but these should **always** be included in your answer, as these 
lettered sub-questions must be detected on every page, even if it overflows from a 
prior question on the previous page.

Think through your reasoning in detail, step by step.

As the final part of your response, please respond with "answer: " followed by a
single comma separated list of numbers, letters and roman numerals on a new line, 
like either of the two examples below:
answer: {n0}, a, i, ii, b, i, {n1}, a, {n2}, a, b, c, i, ii
answer: {c0}, {c1}, {c2}, {n0}, a, b, i, ii, c,

When deciding whether the number refers to a question, look at *all of* the text within

Sometimes the table will not include any headings such as Question, Answer etc. The
question numbers are always on the left hand side, and M1, M2 indicate the marks for
each point. If you see this, it means this is part of the mark scheme, and there is

"""

GENERATE_RESPONSE_PROMPT = """
Your task is to generate a response to question {question_num} below which should 
achieve a total of {target} out of {num_marks} available marks, if it was to be 
marked correctly.

The marking scheme adds marks based on the following guidelines:

----

1.
M marks are for using a correct method and are not lost for purely numerical errors.
A marks are for an accurate answer and depend on preceding M (method) marks. Therefore M0 A1 cannot be awarded.
B marks are independent of M (method) marks and are for a correct final answer, a partially correct answer, or a correct intermediate stage.
SC marks are for special cases that are worthy of some credit.

2.
Unless the answer and marks columns of the mark scheme specify M and A marks etc, or the mark scheme is ‘banded’, then if the correct
answer is clearly given and is not from wrong working full marks should be awarded.

Do not award the marks if the answer was obtained from an incorrect method, i.e. incorrect working is seen and the correct answer clearly follows
from it.

3.
Where follow through (FT) is indicated in the mark scheme, marks can be awarded where the candidate’s work follows correctly from a
previous answer whether or not it was correct.

Figures or expressions that are being followed through are sometimes encompassed by single quotation marks after the word their for clarity,
e.g. FT 180 × (their ‘37’ + 16), or FT 300 – (their ‘52 + 72’). Answers to part questions which are being followed through are indicated by e.g. FT
3 × their (a).

For questions with FT available you must ensure that you refer back to the relevant previous answer. You may find it easier to mark these
questions candidate by candidate rather than question by question.

4.
Where dependent (dep) marks are indicated in the mark scheme, you must check that the candidate has met all the criteria specified for the
mark to be awarded.

5.
The following abbreviations are commonly found in GCSE Mathematics mark schemes.
- **figs 237**, for example, means any answer with only these digits. You should ignore 
 leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 
 would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.
- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.
- **nfww** means not from wrong working.
- **oe** means **or equivalent**.
- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.
- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen 
anywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer
- **soi** means seen or implied.

6.
In questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an 
acceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by 
the instruction ‘mark final answer’.

7.
In questions with a final answer line following working space:

(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks
unless the mark scheme says ‘mark final answer’. Place the annotation ✓ next to the correct answer.

(ii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but the answer line is blank, allow full marks. Place the annotation ✓ next to the
correct answer.

(iii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but a completely different answer is seen on the answer line, then accuracy marks for
the answer are lost. Method marks could still be awarded. Use the M0, M1, M2 annotations as appropriate and place the annotation 
next to the wrong answer.

8.
In questions with a final answer line:

(i)If one answer is provided on the answer line, mark the method that leads to that answer.

(ii)If more than one answer is provided on the answer line and there is a single method provided, award method marks only.

(iii)If more than one answer is provided on the answer line and there is more than one method provided, award zero marks for the question
unless the candidate has clearly indicated which method is to be marked.

9.
In questions with no final answer line:

(i)If a single response is provided, mark as usual.

(ii)If more than one response is provided, award zero marks for the question unless the candidate has clearly indicated which response is to be
marked.

10.
When the data of a question is consistently misread in such a way as not to alter the nature or difficulty of the question, please follow the
candidate’s work and allow follow through for **A** and **B** marks. Deduct 1 mark 
from any **A** or **B** marks earned and record this by using the MR annotation.
**M** marks are not deducted for misreads.

11.
Unless the question asks for an answer to a specific degree of accuracy, always mark at the greatest number of significant figures even if
this is rounded or truncated on the answer line. For example, an answer in the mark scheme is 15.75, which is seen in the working. The
candidate then rounds or truncates this to 15.8, 15 or 16 on the answer line. Allow full marks for the 15.75.

12.
Ranges of answers given in the mark scheme are always inclusive.

13.
For methods not provided for in the mark scheme give as far as possible equivalent marks for equivalent work.

14.
Anything in the mark scheme which is in square brackets […] is not required for the mark to be earned, but if present it must be correct.
