Deep Dive

.. _`issues`: https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/issues
.. _`pull-requests`: https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/pulls

For general users of the framework, who are mainly concerned with learning how to *use* Ivy, then the :ref:`Design` section is the best place to start 🙂

This *deep dive* section is more targeted at people who would like to dive deeper into how Ivy actually works under the hood 🔧

Going through the sections outlined below will get you right into the weeds of the framework 🌱, and hopefully give you a better understanding of what is actually going on behind the scenes 🎬

It's best to go through the sub-sections from start to finish, but you can also dive in at any stage!
We're excited for you to get involved! 🦾
