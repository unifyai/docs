    "As we've already seen, `ivy.transpile` can convert functions and whole libraries from one framework to another. However, in machine learning and deep learning, much of the focus is on trainable modules. Fortunately, Ivy can manage the parameters of these modules and ensure that the transpiled module is fully compatible with the target framework. This allows you to take full advantage of the training utilities provided by any framework and to build complex models on top of the transpiled ones. Let's see how this works!"
