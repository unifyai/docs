Getting Access
==============

You can navigate the Hub freely to check out the available models and their benchmarks. However, to query the models
you will need a **Unify API Key**.

You don't need to create accounts with any other provider exposed in the Hub, this one will act as your master key to all
things deployment 🔑

To generate a key, please head over to `the Unify console <https://console.unify.ai/>`_ and :code:`Sign Up` there.

Once you have created an account, you should be able to generate and copy your API Key from the dashboard.

Now that you have a working API Key, it's time to `Make your First Request! <https://unify.ai/docs/hub/home/make_your_first_request.html>`_

.. note::
    P.S. If you find any problem while creating an account or getting a key, please get in touch with us in
    `Discord <https://discord.com/invite/sXyFF8tDtm>`_ or send an email to :code:`hub@unify.ai` and we'll look into it asap 🏃‍♂️
