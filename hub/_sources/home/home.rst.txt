Welcome to Unify!
=================

We're on a mission to unify and simplify the LLM landscape. Unify lets you:

* **ðŸ”‘ Use any LLM from any Provider**: With a single interface, you can use all LLMs from all providers by simply changing one string.
No need to manage several API keys or handle different input-output formats. Unify handles all of that for you!

* **ðŸ“Š Improve LLM Performance**: Add your own custom tests and evals, and benchmark your own prompts on all models and providers.
Comparing quality, cost and speed, and iterate on your system prompt until all test cases pass, and you can deploy your app!

* **ðŸ”€ Route to the Best LLM**: Improve quality, cost and speed by routing to the perfect model and provider for each individual prompt.

Getting Started
---------------

We recommend you give the concepts section a quick read to get familiar with routing and benchmarking. Once you're ready to go, start by `Signing In <https://console.unify.ai>`_. From this point you can either learn how to:

* **Use our interfaces (Recommended)**: The interfaces guides explain how to interact with endpoints and deploy your custom router in a no-code environment. 

* **Make your first request**: The api guides explains how to start querying endpoints and using the router with our API.  

.. warning::
    Throughout the guides, you'll notice some sections marked as (Beta). **Any section marked as Beta is currently not available** and only illustrate planned features we are currently working on. We're constantly iterating on our roadmap so if you'd like to leave some feedback or suggestion on features you'd like to see, `we'd love to discuss <https://calendly.com/daniel-lenton/beta-discussion>`_ this with you!
