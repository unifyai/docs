This is your central hub for machine learning deployment stacks and inference endpoints. If you're using or planning to use
AI in your application or service, the hub offers various benefits:

* **üöÄ Infrastructure Autotuning**: For any given model, the Hub benchmarks all kind of deployment services and stacks,
  giving you the best infrastructure based on your priorities, be it high-throughput, low cost or low latency.

* **‚öñÔ∏è Impartial Arbiter**: We have no vested interest in you using one provider or another, we deploy and benchmark models accross
  different providers to objectively measure their performance. This allows you to make an informed decision when selecting the
  model or provider that fits your needs.

* **üåê Streamlined Model Access**: Using any model is as simple as making a request to an endpoint. No need to set up any infrastructure
  yourself.

* **üîë One Single Key**: You only need a Unify API Key to access all the endpoints in the hub. No need to create accounts with every provider that
  you want to test.

* **üîì No vendor lock-in**: Each model has a unfied API that enables seamless provider switching. Don't worry about refactoring your code, we handle
  the intricacies and make it painless to move to a different provider or stack if it becomes a better option.

Getting Started
---------------

The best way to try the Hub yourself is to `get an API Key <https://unify.ai/docs/hub/home/getting_access.html>`_ and go through the
tutorial in `Make your First Request <https://unify.ai/docs/hub/home/make_your_first_request.html>`_. Once you are familiar with the
interface and have access to the endpoints, then the `Web Interface <https://unify.ai/hub>`_ is the place to go. Now, you can pick any
model and see the differences between its endpoints before running your queries!

Uploading your own models
-------------------------

You will very soon be able to upload your own models to the Hub, both publicly and privately. We will do all the benchmarking and deployment for
you so that you only have to worry about your application and use the best deployment stack at all times. We are testing this feature internally at the
moment, but if you really want to deploy your models in the hub, feel free to send us an email to :code:`hub@unify.ai`!

Feedback and Feature Requests
-----------------------------

We are excited to hear from you! Whether this is about something that you would do differently, or about a feature that you think would be useful to
include, please let us know either through `our Discord community <https://discord.com/invite/sXyFF8tDtm>`_ or send an email to
:code:`hub@unify.ai`, we'll be more than happy to look into it.
