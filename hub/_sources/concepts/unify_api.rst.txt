Universal API
==============

Thereâ€™s an ever expanding ocean of models and providers, with new LLMs coming out all the time ðŸŒŠ
Each provider requires a unique API key, unique payment processing system, and unique format for querying the API.
When testing out different models and providers, it can quickly become very cumbersome to manage all of these nuances ðŸ« 

Our Universal API provides:

- A single, common interface for all models and providers ðŸŸ¢
- One account, with one balance and one API key ðŸ”‘

To get your universal API key, simply `sign up <https://console.unify.ai>`_!

Querying the API
----------------

You can interact with the API via:

- `HTTP Requests`_ from any programming language
- Our own `Unify Python Package`_
- The `OpenAI Python Package`_
- The `OpenAI NodeJS Package`_

HTTP Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Run the following command in a terminal (replacing :code:`$UNIFY_KEY` with your own).

.. code-block::

    curl -X 'POST' \
        'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{
        "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello."}]
        }'

The :code:`model` field is used to specify both the model and the provider, in the format :code:`model@provider`.

You can find a list of all models, all providers and all endpoints (model + provider pairs) using the following commands:

.. code-block::

    curl -X 'GET' \
      'https://api.unify.ai/v0/models' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
      -H 'accept: application/json'

.. code-block::

    curl -X 'GET' \
      'https://api.unify.ai/v0/providers' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
      -H 'accept: application/json'

.. code-block::

    curl -X 'GET' \
      'https://api.unify.ai/v0/endpoints' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
      -H 'accept: application/json'

You can also pass models and providers as arguments to the above functions, to limit the returned list, like so:

.. code-block::

    curl -X 'GET' \
      'https://api.unify.ai/v0/models?provider=<some_provider>' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
      -H 'accept: application/json'

.. code-block::

    curl -X 'GET' \
      'https://api.unify.ai/v0/providers?model=<some_model>' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
      -H 'accept: application/json'

.. code-block::

    curl -X 'GET' \
      'https://api.unify.ai/v0/endpoints?<model or provider>=<some_model or some_provider>' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
      -H 'accept: application/json'

Requests can easily be made from any language, for example using Python:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests

    url = "https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer UNIFY_API_KEY",
    }
    payload = {
        "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@together-ai",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello."}]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    print(response.text)

The response from a request should look something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    {
    "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@together-ai",
    "created": 1718888877,
    "id": "896bfc1ae84271aa-LHR",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "usage": {
        "completion_tokens": 25,
        "prompt_tokens": 13,
        "total_tokens": 38,
        "cost": 7.6e-06
    },
    "choices": [
        {
        "finish_reason": "stop",
        "index": 0,
        "message": {
            "content": "Hello! It's nice to meet you. Is there something I can help you with or would you like to chat?",
            "role": "assistant",
        },
        "seed": 11563975138181362140
        }
    ]
    }

The output from the LLM is accessed via :code:`choices[0].message.content`.
The :code:`usage` field contains the number of prompt/completion tokens, as well as the total cost of the request, in US$.
In the request you can specify other common parameters, like
:code:`temperature`, :code:`stream` and :code:`max_tokens`.

You can specify all of the parameters that OpenAI supports, but they may not be compatible with every model or provider.

Unify Python Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First, download our `Python package <https://github.com/unifyai/unify>`_ with :code:`pip install unifyai`. You can then quickly get started like so:

.. code-block:: python

    import unify
    client = unify.Unify("llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai", api_key="$UNIFY_KEY")
    response = client.generate("hello world!")

If you save your API key to the environment variables :code:`UNIFY_KEY`,
then you don't need to specify the :code:`api_key` argument in the example above.

You can list the models, providers and endpoints using the functions :code:`unify.utils.list_models()`,
:code:`unify.utils.list_providers()` and :code:`unify.utils.list_endpoints()`

OpenAI Python Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Unify API is designed to be compatible with the OpenAI standard, so if you have existing code that uses the OpenAI Python package,
it's straightforward to try out our API.

.. code-block:: python

    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://api.unify.ai/v0/",
        api_key="YOUR_UNIFY_KEY"
    )

    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3@fireworks-ai",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi."}],
        stream=True,
    )
    for chunk in stream:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")

Remember that the :code:`model` field needs to contain a string of the form :code:`model@provider`.

OpenAI NodeJS Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Likewise, if you have existing code that uses the OpenAI NodeJS package, it's again very straightforward to try out our API.

.. code-block:: javascript

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseUrl: "https://api.unify.ai/v0/",
      apiKey: "YOUR_UNIFY_KEY"
    });

    const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3@fireworks-ai",
      messages: [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi."}],
      stream: true
    });

Again, remember that the :code:`model` field needs to contain a string of the form :code:`model@provider`.

Billing
-------
You only have to manage the balance and billing details for your Unify account, and we handle the spending with each provider behind the scenes.

You can see your balance, top-up your balance, and set automatic refill on the `billing page <https://console.unify.ai/billing>`_.

You can also get your current credit balance with a HTTP request:

.. code-block::

    curl -X 'GET' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/get_credits' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'

which will return something like:

.. code-block::

    {
    "id": "your_user_id",
    "credits": 232.32
    }

This is also supported in our Python client:

.. code-block:: python

    import unify
    credits = unify.utils.get_credits()

Advanced features
-----------------

Custom endpoints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have a custom model which is deployed as an endpoint on (for example a fine-tuned model with OpenAI or Together AI) you can `add your own custom endpoint <https://console.unify.ai/endpoints>`_.

To create a custom endpoint, you need the Endpoint URL and the relevant API key. You can query a custom endpoint using the model string :code:`<endpoint-name>@custom`

LLM Fallbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sometimes individual providers have outages, which can disrupt live workflows in production. 

To combat this, set a list of fallback models, so if one provider is down or fails for some reason, the request will go to the next model on the list, and so on, until either the request succeeds, or the end of the list is reached.

To specify the list of fallback models, use :code:`->` between individual model tags, so the model string becomes :code:`model_a@provider_a->model_b@provider_b`.

There is no limit on the number of models that can be specified. The :code:`model` field in the response contains the model and provider that the request actually went to.
