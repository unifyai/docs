## Introduction
Debate-App is a web application that enables a back-and-forth conversation between two Language Models (LLMs) on a topic chosen by the user. Users can select any two models, input a query, and visualize the dialogue between the LLMs in real-time. Built using Unify and deployed with Streamlit, this application provides a platform for users to witness AI-generated debates and explore the capabilities of different language models.


## Tech Stack
- **Streamlit**: Used for creating the web application interface that is intuitive and interactive.
- **Unify AI**: Provides the backend LLMs that power the interactions within the application. Unify's API is utilized to send prompts to the LLMs and receive their responses in real-time.
