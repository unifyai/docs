Design
======

This section is aimed at general users, who would like to learn how to use Ivy, and are less concerned about how it all works under the hood ðŸ”§

The :ref:`Deep Dive` section is more targeted at potential contributors, and at users who would like to dive deeper into the weeds of the frameworkðŸŒ±, and gain a better understanding of what is actually going on behind the scenes ðŸŽ¬

If that sounds like you, feel free to check out the :ref:`Deep Dive` section after you've gone through the higher level overview which is covered in this *design* section!

| So, starting off with our higher level *design* section, Ivy can fulfill two distinct purposes:
|
| 1. enable automatic code conversions between frameworks
| 2. serve as a new ML framework with multi-framework support
|
| The Ivy codebase can then be split into three categories which are labelled (a),
| (b) and (c) below, and can be further split into 8 distinct submodules.
| The eight submodules are Ivy API, Backend Handler, Backend API, Ivy Array,
| Ivy Container, Ivy Stateful API, and finally Frontend API.

| All eight fall into one of the three categories as follows:
