title: "Delete Context"
api: 'DELETE /v0/project/{project_name}/contexts/{context_name}'
---
Deletes a context from a project. This will not delete the logs or artifacts
within the context, but will remove their association with this context.

When include_children is True (default), all child contexts sharing the same
prefix will also be deleted. For Assistants/UnityTests projects, logs that
exist in sibling contexts (All/X, User/All/X) will also have their associations
cleaned up.

#### Authorizations

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required="true">
  Bearer authentication header of the form `Bearer <token>`, where `<token>` is your auth token.
</ParamField>

#### Path Parameters

<ParamField query="project_name" type="string" required="true">
Name of the project to delete context from.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="context_name" type="string" required="true">
Name of the context to delete.
</ParamField>

#### Query Parameters

<ParamField query="include_children" type="boolean"  default="true">
Whether to delete child contexts (which share the same '/' separated prefix). When True, deleting 'experiments' will also delete 'experiments/trial1', 'experiments/trial2', etc. The parent context does not need to exist for children to be deleted.
</ParamField>
